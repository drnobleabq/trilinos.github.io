Trilinos is comprised of over 50 packages. Each Trilinos package is a self-contained, independent piece of software with its own set of requirements, its own development team and group of users. Because of this, Trilinos itself is designed to respect the autonomy of packages.  Use the Packages dropdown menu to see all packages. Below we mention some of the most important ones.

## Actively developed Trilinos packages
The following packages are undergoing active development in support of new applications and computing platforms.

### Basic Linear Algebra Libraries
- [Tpetra](tpetra.html "Tpetra") -- The primary parallel linear algebra library in Trilinos.
- [Kokkos](kokkos.html "Kokkos") -- Core kernel package.

### Preconditioners
- [Muelu](muelu.html "Muelu") -- Algebraic multigrid for emerging problems and architectures.
- [Ifpack2](ifpack2.html "Ifpack2") -- Contains preconditioners that operate on the templated linear-algebra objects provided by the Tpetra package. Intended as a templated replacement for Ifpack.

### Solvers

#### Linear Solvers

- [Teuchos](teuchos.html "Teuchos") -- Provides wrappers for select BLAS and LAPACK routines. See also description under “Basic Linear Algebra Libraries.”
- [Belos](belos.html "Belos") -- Next-generation iterative solvers written using a traits interface, meaning that it has no explicit dependence on any concrete linear algebra library. Instead, it can be used with any concrete linear algebra library that implements the Thyra abstract interfaces and even Epetra directly.
- [Amesos2](amesos2.html "Amesos2") -- Direct solver library.htmlinterface in Trilinos. Amesos2 provides interfaces to third-party direct solvers for templated matrices and vectors in Trilinos.

#### Nonlinear, Transient, and Optimization Solvers

- [NOX](nox_and_loca.html "NOX and LOCA") -- Nonlinear solver package. Abstract and concrete classes for construction and solution of nonlinear problems.
- [LOCA](nox_and_loca.html "NOX and LOCA") -- LOCA is a software library for performing bifurcation analysis of large-scale applications. When implemented with an application code, LOCA enables the tracking of solution branches as a function of system parameters and the direct tracking of bifurcation points. LOCA is designed to drive application codes that use Newton’s method to locate steady-state solutions to nonlinear problems.
- [ROL](rol "Rapid Optimization Library (ROL)") -- Rapid Optimization Library (ROL) is Trilinos’ next-generation package for large-scale optimization. It is used for the solution of optimal design, optimal control and inverse problems in large-scale engineering applications. Other uses include mesh optimization and image processing. ROL solves nonlinear nonconvex optimization problems with general equality and inequality constraints, with efficient specializations for various problem types. ROL’s matrix-free API enables direct use of application data structures and memory spaces, linear solvers, nonlinear solvers and preconditioners.
- [Tempus](tempus.html "Tempus") -- Time-integration framework for advanced transient analysis, including various time integrators and embedded sensitivity analysis.

### Eigensolvers

- [Anasazi](anasazi.html "Anasazi") -- Anasazi is an extensible and interoperable framework for large-scale eigenvalue algorithms. The motivation for this framework is to provide a generic interface to a collection of algorithms for solving large-scale eigenvalue problems. Anasazi is interoperable because both the matrix and vectors (defining the eigenspace) are considered to be opaque objects—only knowledge of the matrix and vectors via elementary operations is necessary. An implementation of Anasazi is accomplished via the use of interfaces. Current interfaces available include Epetra and so any libraries that understand Epetra matrices and vectors (such as AztecOO) may also be used in conjunction with Anasazi.

### Automatic Differentiation

- [Sacado](sacado.html "Sacado") -- Sacado is a package for automatic differentiation of C++ programs It provides simple yet fast and efficient classes for forward, revers and Taylor polynomial mode automatic differentiation using C++ template and operator overloading. The resulting derivatives can be leveraged in numerous ways including nonlinear solves with [NOX](nox_and_loca.html "NOX and LOCA") continuation and bifurcation analysis with [LOCA](nox_and_loca.html "NOX and LOCA") optimization with [MOOCHO](moocho.html "MOOCHO"), and time integration with [Rythmos](rythmos.html "Rythmos").
- [Stokhos](stokhos.html "Stokhos") -- Stokhos is a package for intrusive stochastic Galerkin uncertainty quantification methods. It provides methods for computing well-known intrusive stochastic Galerkin projections such as Polynomial Chaos and Generalized Polynomial Chaos, interfaces for forming the resulting nonlinear systems, and linear solver methods for solving block stochastic Galerkin linear systems.

### Discretization Utilities
- [Panzer](panzer.html "Panzer") -- Panzer is a package for performing finte element analysis
- [Intrepid2](intrepid2.html "Intrepid2") -- Performance portable tools for the local assembly of high-order compatible finte element discretizations.
- [Phalanx](phalanx.html "Phalanx") -- Phalanx is a DAG-based local field evaluation kernel specifically designed for general partial differential equation solvers.
